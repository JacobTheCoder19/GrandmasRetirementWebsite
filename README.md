<h2><em>✨ Purpose / Inspiration ✨</em></h2>
&emsp;This project was inspired by my grandma. She asked me one day if I could put a counter on her phone and computer at work so she knew how long she had left until she retired. My solution to this was to just make a website that she could go to on any device at any time to see how long until she retires. The website might not be as advanced or as flashy as others but I decided it looked best with just a simple layout and design.

<h2><em>⚙️ How It Works ⚙️</em></h2>
&emsp;The countdown website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device. 
<br>
&emsp;The main feature of the website is the countdown timer, which calculates the time remaining until the specified retirement date (May 1, 2025). The JavaScript code updates the countdown every second, displaying the remaining months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

&emsp;The design includes a celebratory title and an engaging image to enhance the festive atmosphere. The countdown timer is styled with CSS to ensure it is visually appealing and easy to read.
